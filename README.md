# goldmark-lint

A Markdown linter written in Go using the [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) parser.
It implements a subset of the rules from [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) /
[markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) and supports auto-fixing for
select rules.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/mrueg/goldmark-lint/cmd/goldmark-lint@latest
```

## Usage

```
goldmark-lint glob0 [glob1] [...] [globN] [--fix] [--help]

Glob expressions:
  *  matches any number of characters, but not /
  ?  matches a single character, but not /
  ** matches any number of characters, including /

Optional parameters:
  --fix   updates files to resolve fixable issues
  --help  writes this message to the console and exits without doing anything else

Exit codes:
  0: Linting was successful and there were no errors
  1: Linting was successful and there were errors
  2: Linting was not successful due to a problem or failure
```

### Example

```sh
# Lint all Markdown files in the current directory tree
goldmark-lint '**/*.md'

# Lint and auto-fix fixable issues
goldmark-lint --fix '**/*.md'
```

## Configuration

goldmark-lint reads configuration from a `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml` (or `.yml`,
`.jsonc`, `.json`) file, following the same discovery and format as
[markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2).

The config file is searched starting from the current working directory and
walking up to the filesystem root. The first file found is used.

### Config file format

```yaml
# .markdownlint-cli2.yaml
config:
  default: true          # enable all rules (this is the default when omitted)
  MD013:
    line_length: 100     # override line length for MD013
  MD033:
    allowed_elements:    # allow specific HTML elements
      - br
  MD001: false           # disable MD001

ignores:
  - "vendor/**"          # ignore files matching these glob patterns
  - "node_modules/**"
```

The `config` section mirrors the
[markdownlint configuration](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#options)
format:

- Set a rule ID to `false` to disable it.
- Set a rule ID to `true` to enable it with default options.
- Set a rule ID to an object to enable it with specific options.
- Set `default: false` to disable all rules not explicitly listed.
